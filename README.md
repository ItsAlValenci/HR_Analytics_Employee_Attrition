# HR Analytics: Employee Attrition at Salifort Motors

This is a capstone data science project focused on providing data-driven HR recommendations for **Salifort Motors**. The goal is to identify what factors are most likely to influence employee turnover and to support decision-making through predictive modeling.

The project follows the **PACE** framework and applies a full data science pipeline (from business understanding and EDA to model evaluation).

## Project Objectives

- Understand the employee experience and performance landscape  
- Use data to detect key drivers of employee departure  
- Build and compare classification models to predict attrition  
- Communicate findings clearly to support HR strategy decisions

## Methodology

This project follows the **PACE framework**:

### 1. Plan
- Clarify goals with stakeholders  
- Frame the problem: “What makes employees likely to leave?”

### 2. Analyze
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA)  
- Identify patterns, correlations, and potential features for modeling  
- Detect data quality issues  

### 3. Construct
- Prepare the dataset for modeling (encoding, scaling, splitting)  
- Train multiple classification models (e.g., Logistic Regression, etc.)  
- Tune and evaluate model performance  

### 4. Execute
- Compare models using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score  
- Interpret feature importance
